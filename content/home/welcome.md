**Natural Language Processing** (NLP) is a subfield of **Artificial Intelligence** concerned with how computers deal with language.
NLP is a growing global industry with many active research directions.
In CardiffNLP, we work on various aspects of **theoretical and applied NLP**.
We believe that **NLP is interdisciplinary** in nature, and that is why we are interested in both **developing NLP technologies** and **involving domain experts** who can bring the field forward, and **enable impact** in applications that matter.

We conduct [active research](research) in diverse NLP topics such as lexical semantics, commonsense reasoning, multilinguality, downstream and social NLP applications (e.g. health, social media) and many others.
