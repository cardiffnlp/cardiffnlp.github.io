summary: Talk by Sian Gooding (University of Cambridge)
abstract: "The difficulty of a text is highly subjective, yet this factor is often neglected in text simplification and readability systems which use a “one-size-fits-all” approach. In this talk, I will discuss what contributes to text complexity, emphasising how this is dependent on the intended audience. Furthermore, I will present work showing how active learning can be used to create bespoke complexity models for individual readers."
