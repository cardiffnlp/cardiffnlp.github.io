summary: Talk by [Dawn Knight](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/knightd5) (Cardiff University - ENCAP)
abstract: "This presentation showcases some recent interdisciplinary and cross-institutional projects involving applied/corpus linguists (at Cardiff University) and colleagues in NLP. This will include a short demonstration of the [CorCenCC corpus](www.corcencc.org) (the National Corpus of Contemporary Welsh), and an overview of a range of satellite projects including the Thesawrws and FreeTxt (a bilingual toolkit that supports the analysis and visualisation of free text data) projects, and will overview the recently launched GDC-WDG website (an online collection of freely available digital resources designed to support the exploration, analysis, learning, and referencing of the Welsh language). The talk will also signpost future plans for work in this broad area, and will welcome discussions of potential areas for future collaboration/synergy."
