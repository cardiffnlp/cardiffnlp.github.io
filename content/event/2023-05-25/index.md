summary: Talk by [Yuxiang Wu](https://www.yuxiang.me/) (University College London)
abstract: "Recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) unveils exciting and uncharted territory of multi-agent interactions between multiple LLMs. Our focus will be on how multiple LLMs can collaborate and compete within complex scenarios and games. To study this, we have crafted ChatArena, an innovative library that fosters the creation of multi-agent language game environments and encourages research on the autonomous behaviour and social interaction of LLM agents. The talk will elucidate the core features of ChatArena, such as its flexible framework for defining multiple players and environments, built on the Markov Decision Process, a collection of language game environments for understanding and benchmarking agent LLMs, and its user-friendly interfaces, including Web UI and CLI for developing and engineering LLM agents. We welcome you to discover more about our project and to engage with a live demonstration at [http://chatarena.org](http://chatarena.org) and [http://demo.chatarena.org](http://demo.chatarena.org), respectively.
