Alessandro will focus on the paper ["A good pun is its own reword": Can Large Language Models Understand Puns?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13599) (Xu et al. EMNLP 2024), will prepare a short presentation and then we will have time for discussion

Another relevant paper that will be mentioned in the reading group including a pun dataset is: [ExPUNations: Augmenting Puns with Keywords and Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13513) (Sun et al. EMNLP 2022).

There is no need to read the papers in advance, but could be helpful to at least skim through them.
