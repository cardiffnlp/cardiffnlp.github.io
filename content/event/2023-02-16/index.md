abstract: "This talk will discuss (ongoing) research on linking and classifying texts with knowledge graphs (KGs). There are mainly two parts: (i) KG enrichment, identifying out-of-KG mentions through entity linking (and their placement into the KG); (ii) Classification of texts into concepts in a large KG. We will present applications in the clinical domain as examples, e.g., clinical ontologies, including UMLS, SNOMED-CT, and ICD, and the current state of automated clinical coding [1-2], and propose future studies."
