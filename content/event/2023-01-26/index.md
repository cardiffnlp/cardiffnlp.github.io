summary: Talk by [Nedjma Ousidhoum](https://nedjmaou.github.io/) (University of Cambridge)
abstract: "There has been a rising interest in automating toxic language detection and fact-checking to help experts with online moderation and fact verification. However, in the absence of clear definitions of crucial terms and expertsâ€™ needs, one may ask how we can have the impact we aim for and build robust tools for toxic language detection and automated fact-checking. 

In this presentation, I will share insights and lessons learned from past and ongoing work on toxic language detection and automated fact-checking. I will talk about (1) the construction of multilingual resources for toxic language detection and related problems (e.g., selection bias) and (2) work on question generation for fact-checking.
