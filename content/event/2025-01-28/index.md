summary: Talk by [Joseph Marvin Imperial](https://www.josephimperial.com/) (University of Bath)
abstract: "Technical standards, or simply standards, are documented rules, regulations, and guidelines that promote the interoperability, quality, and accuracy of systems and processes. In recent years, the adoption of generative AI (GenAI) models like ChatGPT has surged, generating implementation interests across standard-driven industries such as aerospace, security and defense, healthcare, and education. In this talk, I will introduce opportunities emerging from an exciting new research landscape in GenAI alignment, including my research presented at EMNLP2024 and recent government initiatives, and discuss how this field can shape the future of regulatory and industrial operational compliance through standards."
