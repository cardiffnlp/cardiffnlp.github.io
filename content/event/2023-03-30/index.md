summary: Discussion around impact of technology powered by large language models in NLP research
abstract: "This session is thought as a discussion around the impact of ChatGPT (and technology powered by large language models in general) in NLP research, and in particular related to our areas of research. There is not a pre-defined agenda, and the discussion can be as broad as possible. One of the goals of the session is also to discuss potential (new) opportunities, both short and mid/long term."
