**Invited Speaker 1:** [Elisa Sanchez Bayona](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NA3JxnsAAAAJ)

**Title:** "From Automatic Metaphor Processing in Spanish to a Multilingual Perspective: Annotation, Systems, and Evaluation"

**Abstract:** Metaphors are pervasive in our daily utterances, which is why the automatic processing of metaphorical expressions has gained popularity in the NLP field. Specifically, we explore the tasks of metaphor detection and interpretation and how language models respond to this cognitive-linguistic phenomenon from a cross-lingual perspective.

**Invited Speaker 2:** [Joseba Fernandez de Landa Aguirre](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=03eS_sEAAAAJ)

**Title:** "Instructing Large Language Models for Low-Resource Languages"

**Abstract:** Instruction-tuned, open-weight LLMs for low-resourced languages are still rare, due challenges such as the lack of instruction datasets. For Basque, we leveraged the largest available corpora, evaluation benchmarks, and a new training strategy to develop a model that performs on par with proprietary systems. Beyond benchmark success over open weighted backbone models, our model was validated in a community LLM evaluation arena. Future work will explore applications in domain-specific contexts such as legal texts, news, and parliamentary discourse.
