Yi will provide an overview of the topic by focusing on the following papers (see below) and then we will have time for discussion:

- [BBQ: A Hand-Built Bias Benchmark for Question Answering](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.165/)
- [KoBBQ: Korean Bias Benchmark for Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16778)
- [CBBQ: A Chinese Bias Benchmark Dataset Curated with Human-AI Collaboration for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16244)

There is no need to read the papers, but could be helpful to at least skim through them.
