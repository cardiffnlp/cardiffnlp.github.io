summary: Talk by [James Thorne](https://jamesthorne.com/) (KAIST Graduate School of AI)
abstract: "In this talk, Iâ€™ll cover two recent papers for preference alignment: Odds-Ratio Preference Optimisation (ORPO, EMNLP 2024), discussing the role of the reference model for preference alignment (e.g. DPO , RLHF), and Margin-aware Preference Optimization (under review @ CVPR ), thinking about the risks of reference mismatch: where the preference alignment data has features diverging from the reference model."
