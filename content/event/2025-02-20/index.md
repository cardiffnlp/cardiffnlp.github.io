abstract: "CSS as a field is of growing field with increasing importance. LLMs are powerful tools that can help conduct such analysis at scale but come with several caveats and biases of their own. In this talk, I will share some examples of past and ongoing work on using LLMs as a tool for analysis of societal phenomena and as tools for analysis of models themselves. I will share some lessons learnt on the way when using LLMs for subjective tasks and on ensuring a robust methodology."
