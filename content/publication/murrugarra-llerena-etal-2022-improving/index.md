abstract: We propose an approach for comparing curricula of study programs in higher
  education. Pre-trained word embeddings are fine-tuned in a study program classification
  task, where each curriculum is represented by the names and content of its courses.
  By combining metric learning with a novel course-guided attention mechanism, our
  method obtains more accurate curriculum representations than strong baselines. Experiments
  on a new dataset with curricula of computing programs demonstrate the intuitive
  power of our approach via attention weights, topic modeling, and embeddings visualizations.
  We also present a use case comparing computing curricula from USA and Latin America
  to showcase the capabilities of our improved embeddings representations.
