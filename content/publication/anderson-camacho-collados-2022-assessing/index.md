abstract: The increase in performance in NLP due to the prevalence of distributional
  models and deep learning has brought with it a reciprocal decrease in interpretability.
  This has spurred a focus on what neural networks learn about natural language with
  less of a focus on how. Some work has focused on the data used to develop data-driven
  models, but typically this line of work aims to highlight issues with the data,
  e.g. highlighting and offsetting harmful biases. This work contributes to the relatively
  untrodden path of what is required in data for models to capture meaningful representations
  of natural language. This is entails evaluating how well English and Spanish semantic
  spaces capture a particular type of relational knowledge, namely the traits associated
  with concepts (e.g. bananas-yellow), and exploring the role of co-occurrences in
  this context.
