abstract: Social media platforms host discussions about a wide variety of topics that
  arise everyday. Making sense of all the content and organising it into categories
  is an arduous task. A common way to deal with this issue is relying on topic modeling,
  but topics discovered using this technique are difficult to interpret and can differ
  from corpus to corpus. In this paper, we present a new task based on tweet topic
  classification and release two associated datasets. Given a wide range of topics
  covering the most important discussion points in social media, we provide training
  and testing data from recent time periods that can be used to evaluate tweet classification
  models. Moreover, we perform a quantitative evaluation and analysis of current general-
  and domain-specific language models on the task, which provide more insights on
  the challenges and nature of the task.
