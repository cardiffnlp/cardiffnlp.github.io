abstract: Despite its importance, the time variable has been largely neglected in
  the NLP and language model literature. In this paper, we present TimeLMs, a set
  of language models specialized on diachronic Twitter data. We show that a continual
  learning strategy contributes to enhancing Twitter-based language modelsâ€² capacity
  to deal with future and out-of-distribution tweets, while making them competitive
  with standardized and more monolithic benchmarks. We also perform a number of qualitative
  analyses showing how they cope with trends and peaks in activity involving specific
  named entities or concept drift. TimeLMs is available at github.com/cardiffnlp/timelms.
