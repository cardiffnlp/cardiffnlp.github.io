abstract: This project investigates the capabilities of Machine Translation models
  for generating translations at varying levels of readability, focusing on texts
  related to COVID-19. Whilst it is possible to automatically translate this information,
  the resulting text may contain specialised terminology, or may be written in a style
  that is difficult for lay readers to understand. So far, we have collected a new
  dataset with manual simplifications for English and Spanish sentences in the TICO-19
  dataset, as well as implemented baseline pipelines combining Machine Translation
  and Text Simplification models.
