abstract: 'In this paper we present TweetNLP, an integrated platform for Natural Language
  Processing (NLP) in social media. TweetNLP supports a diverse set of NLP tasks,
  including generic focus areas such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition,
  as well as social media-specific tasks such as emoji prediction and offensive language
  identification. Task-specific systems are powered by reasonably-sized Transformer-based
  language models specialized on social media text (in particular, Twitter) which
  can be run without the need for dedicated hardware or cloud services. The main contributions
  of TweetNLP are: (1) an integrated Python library for a modern toolkit supporting
  social media analysis using our various task-specific models adapted to the social
  domain; (2) an interactive online demo for codeless experimentation using our models;
  and (3) a tutorial covering a wide variety of typical social media applications.'
