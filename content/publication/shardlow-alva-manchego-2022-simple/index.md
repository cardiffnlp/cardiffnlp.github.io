abstract: Specialist high-quality information is typically first available in English,
  and it is written in a language that may be difficult to understand by most readers.
  While Machine Translation technologies contribute to mitigate the first issue, the
  translated content will most likely still contain complex language. In order to
  investigate and address both problems simultaneously, we introduce Simple TICO-19,
  a new language resource containing manual simplifications of the English and Spanish
  portions of the TICO-19 corpus for Machine Translation of COVID-19 literature. We
  provide an in-depth description of the annotation process, which entailed designing
  an annotation manual and employing four annotators (two native English speakers
  and two native Spanish speakers) who simplified over 6,000 sentences from the English
  and Spanish portions of the TICO-19 corpus. We report several statistics on the
  new dataset, focusing on analysing the improvements in readability from the original
  texts to their simplified versions. In addition, we propose baseline methodologies
  for automatically generating the simplifications, translations and joint translation
  and simplifications contained in our dataset.
