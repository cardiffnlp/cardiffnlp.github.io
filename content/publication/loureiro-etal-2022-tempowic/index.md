abstract: Language evolves over time, and word meaning changes accordingly. This is
  especially true in social media, since its dynamic nature leads to faster semantic
  shifts, making it challenging for NLP models to deal with new content and trends.
  However, the number of datasets and models that specifically address the dynamic
  nature of these social platforms is scarce. To bridge this gap, we present TempoWiC,
  a new benchmark especially aimed at accelerating research in social media-based
  meaning shift. Our results show that TempoWiC is a challenging benchmark, even for
  recently-released language models specialized in social media.
