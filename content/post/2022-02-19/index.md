Do you aim to make information more accessible to everyone? I am looking for students to work on different tasks for text adaption (e.g. Text Simplification, Readability Assessment, etc.).

You could either apply to one of the School of Computer Science [studentships](https://findaphd.com/phds/project/natural-language-processing-for-text-adaptation/?p141418) (**Deadline 29/04**), or be [self-funded](https://findaphd.com/phds/project/natural-language-processing-for-text-adaptation-self-funded-students-only/?p141424). 
Do not hesitate to get in touch if you're interested!
