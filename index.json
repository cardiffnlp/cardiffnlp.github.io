Early contact with health care services is critical for achieving accurate diagnosis and improving patient outcomes. Key symptoms of major depressive disorder (depression hereafter) such as cognitive distortions are observed in verbal communication, which can also manifest in the structure of written language. Thus, the automatic analysis of text outputs may provide opportunities for early intervention in settings where written communication is rich and regular, such as social media and web-based forums. Objective: The objective of this study was 2-fold. We sought to gauge the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches to identify users of the mass web-based forum Reddit, who eventually disclose a diagnosis of depression. We then aimed to determine whether the time between a forum post and a depression diagnosis date was a relevant factor in performing this detection. Methods: A total of 2 Reddit data sets containing posts belonging to users with and without a history of depression diagnosis were obtained. The intersection of these data sets provided users with an estimated date of depression diagnosis. This derived data set was used as an input for several machine learning classifiers, including transformer-based language models (LMs). Results: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and MentalBERT transformer-based LMs proved the most effective in distinguishing forum users with a known depression diagnosis from those without. They each obtained a mean F1-score of 0.64 across the experimental setups used for binary classification. The results also suggested that the final 12 to 16 weeks (about 3-4 months) of posts before a depressed user's estimated diagnosis date are the most indicative of their illness, with data before that period not helping the models detect more accurately. Furthermore, in the 4- to 8-week period before the user's estimated diagnosis date, their posts exhibited more negative sentiment than any other 4-week period in their post history. Conclusions: Transformer-based LMs may be used on data from web-based social media forums to identify users at risk for psychiatric conditions such as depression. Language features picked up by these classifiers might predate depression onset by weeks to months, enabling proactive mental health care interventions to support those at risk for this condition.","tags":[],"title":"Enabling Early Health Care Intervention by Detecting Depression in Users of Web-Based Forums using Language Models: Longitudinal Analysis and Evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dimosthenis Antypas","Alun Preece","Jose Camacho-Collados"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676388902,"objectID":"aaeefe0f0a0c98192836df55a0ab3792","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/antypas-2023-negativity/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T15:35:02.628713Z","relpermalink":"/publication/antypas-2023-negativity/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Negativity spreads faster: A large-scale multilingual twitter analysis on the role of sentiment in political communication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose Camacho-Collados"],"categories":null,"content":"Invited Speaker: Diana Contreras Mojica\n","date":1669899600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669899600,"objectID":"02bb66273e37958d72979d4fafd68731","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/event/2022-12-01/","publishdate":"2022-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2022-12-01/","section":"event","summary":"Talk by [Diana Contreras Mojica](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/2534179-Contreras-Mojica-Diana) (Cardiff University - EARTH)","tags":[],"title":"Seminar: \"Social Media and Crowdsourcing Platforms in Disaster Management\"","type":"event"},{"authors":["Laura Vásquez-Rodrı́guez","Pedro-Manuel Cuenca-Jiménez","Sergio Morales-Esquivel","Fernando Alva-Manchego"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676384572,"objectID":"7de54f9a19de14a1e9653a222821755d","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/vasquez-rodriguez-etal-2022-benchmark/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T14:22:52.486936Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vasquez-rodriguez-etal-2022-benchmark/","section":"publication","summary":"We release a new benchmark for Automated Readability Assessment (ARA) of texts in Spanish.

An analysis based on readability indices shows that our proposed datasets groupings are suitable for their designated readability level. We use our benchmark to train neural ARA models based on BERT in zero-shot, few-shot, and cross-lingual settings. Results show that either a monolingual or multilingual pre-trained model can achieve good results when fine-tuned in language-specific data.

It includes general-purpose datasets such as SQuAD for English, datasets from ten domains and two styles, as well as datasets in eight different languages. Using QG-Bench as a reference, we perform an extensive analysis of the capabilities of language models for the task. First, we propose robust QG baselines based on fine-tuning generative language models. Then, we complement automatic evaluation based on standard metrics with an extensive manual evaluation, which in turn sheds light on the difficulty of evaluating QG models. Finally, we analyse both the domain adaptability of these models as well as the effectiveness of multilingual models in languages other than English.QG-Bench is released along with the fine-tuned models presented in the paper (https://github.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation), which are also available as a demo (https://autoqg.net/).","tags":[],"title":"Generative Language Models for Paragraph-Level Question Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aleks Edwards","Asahi Ushio","Jose Camacho-Collados","Hélène de Ribaupierre","Alun Preece"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676388903,"objectID":"37fc5ea158088a0aa02c5a38556562d8","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/edwards-etal-2022-guiding/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T15:35:03.124633Z","relpermalink":"/publication/edwards-etal-2022-guiding/","section":"publication","summary":"Data augmentation techniques are widely used for enhancing the performance of machine learning models by tackling class imbalance issues and data sparsity. State-of-the-art generative language models have been shown to provide significant gains across different NLP tasks. However, their applicability to data augmentation for text classification tasks in few-shot settings have not been fully explored, especially for specialised domains. In this paper, we leverage GPT-2 (Radford et al, 2019) for generating artificial training instances in order to improve classification performance. Our aim is to analyse the impact the selection process of seed training examples has over the quality of GPT-generated samples and consequently the classifier performance. We propose a human-in-the-loop approach for selecting seed samples. Further, we compare the approach to other seed selection strategies that exploit the characteristics of specialised domains such as human-created class hierarchical structure and the presence of noun phrases. Our results show that fine-tuning GPT-2 in a handful of label instances leads to consistent classification improvements and outperform competitive baselines. The seed selection strategies developed in this work lead to significant improvements over random seed selection for specialised domains. We show that guiding text generation through domain expert selection can lead to further improvements, which opens up interesting research avenues for combining generative models and active learning.","tags":[],"title":"Guiding Generative Language Models for Data Augmentation in Few-Shot Text Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffri Murrugarra-Llerena","Fernando Alva-Manchego","Nils Murrugarra-Llerena"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676384572,"objectID":"ca38b8ab768b662b62593735345829ac","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/murrugarra-llerena-etal-2022-improving/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T14:22:52.254197Z","relpermalink":"/publication/murrugarra-llerena-etal-2022-improving/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose an approach for comparing curricula of study programs in higher education.

When it comes to pre-trained language models (PLM), prior work has been focusing on probing relational knowledge this by filling the blanks in pre-defined prompts such as ``The capital of France is ---''. However, these probes may be affected by the co-occurrence of target relation words and entities (e.g. ``capital″, ``France″ and ``Paris″) in the pre-training corpus. In this work, we extend these probing methodologies leveraging analogical proportions as a proxy to probe relational knowledge in transformer-based PLMs without directly presenting the desired relation. In particular, we analysed the ability of PLMs to understand (1) the directionality of a given relation (e.g. Paris-France is not the same as France-Paris); (2) the ability to distinguish types on a given relation (both France and Japan are countries); and (3) the relation itself (Paris is the capital of France, but not Rome). Our results show how PLMs are extremely accurate at (1) and (2), but have clear room for improvement for (3). To better understand the reasons behind this behaviour and mistakes made by PLMs, we provide an extended quantitative analysis based on relevant factors such as frequency.","tags":[],"title":"Probing Relational Knowledge in Language Models via Word Analogies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose Camacho-Collados","Kiamehr Rezaee","Talayeh Riahi","Asahi Ushio","Daniel Loureiro","Dimosthenis Antypas","Joanne Boisson","Luis Espinosa-Anke","Fangyu Liu","Eugenio Martı́nez Cámara"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676388905,"objectID":"797fb0fe2f8af86df4ba8a216fcdabfc","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/camacho-collados-etal-2022-tweetnlp/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T15:35:05.213302Z","relpermalink":"/publication/camacho-collados-etal-2022-tweetnlp/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we present TweetNLP, an integrated platform for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in social media.

Nonetheless, this progress has been mainly tested in well-formatted documents such as news, Wikipedia, or scientific articles. In social media the landscape is different, in which it adds another layer of complexity due to its noisy and dynamic nature. In this paper, we focus on NER in Twitter, one of the largest social media platforms, and construct a new NER dataset, TweetNER7, which contains seven entity types annotated over 11,382 tweets from September 2019 to August 2021. The dataset was constructed by carefully distributing the tweets over time and taking representative trends as a basis. Along with the dataset, we provide a set of language model baselines and perform an analysis on the language model performance on the task, especially analyzing the impact of different time periods. In particular, we focus on three important temporal aspects in our analysis: short-term degradation of NER models over time, strategies to fine-tune a language model over different periods, and self-labeling as an alternative to lack of recently-labeled data. TweetNER7 is released publicly (https://huggingface.co/datasets/tner/tweetner7) along with the models fine-tuned on it (NER models have been integrated into TweetNLP and can be found at https://github.com/asahi417/tner/tree/master/examples/tweetner7_paper).","tags":[],"title":"Named Entity Recognition in Twitter: A Dataset and Analysis on Short-Term Temporal Shifts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martina Miliani","Serena Auriemma","Fernando Alva-Manchego","Alessandro Lenci"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676384573,"objectID":"4c5a569046dcd8de27af62ea996a49df","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/miliani-etal-2022-neural/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T14:22:52.773322Z","relpermalink":"/publication/miliani-etal-2022-neural/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic Readability Assessment aims at assigning a complexity level to a given text, which could help improve the accessibility to information in specific domains, such as the administrative one. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a Neural Pairwise Ranking Model (NPRM) for sentence-level readability assessment of Italian administrative texts. To deal with data scarcity, we experiment with cross-lingual, cross- and in-domain approaches, and test our models on Admin-It, a new parallel corpus in the Italian administrative language, containing sentences simplified using three different rewriting strategies. We show that NPRMs are effective in zero-shot scenarios (~0.78 ranking accuracy), especially with ranking pairs containing simplifications produced by overall rewriting at the sentence-level, and that the best results are obtained by adding in-domain data (achieving perfect performance for such sentence pairs). Finally, we investigate where NPRMs failed, showing that the characteristics of the training data, rather than its size, have a bigger effect on a model′s performance.","tags":[],"title":"Neural Readability Pairwise Ranking for Sentences in Italian Administrative Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"📅 16th and 17th Nov, 10am - 5pm\n📍 Tramshed Tech\nSponsored by AMPLYFI\nAt this 2-day hackathon you’ll enter the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing.

In particular, term weighting is the basis for keyword extraction. However, there are relatively few evaluation studies that shed light about the strengths and shortcomings of each weighting scheme. In fact, in most cases researchers and practitioners resort to the well-known tf-idf as default, despite the existence of other suitable alternatives, including graph-based models. In this paper, we perform an exhaustive and large-scale empirical comparison of both statistical and graph-based term weighting methods in the context of keyword extraction. Our analysis reveals some interesting findings such as the advantages of the less-known lexical specificity with respect to tf-idf, or the qualitative differences between statistical and graph-based methods. Finally, based on our findings we discuss and devise some suggestions for practitioners.

Among others, this makes it possible to distill high-quality word vectors from pre-trained language models. However, it is currently unclear to what extent it is possible to distill relation embeddings, i.e. vectors that characterize the relationship between two words. Such relation embeddings are appealing because they can, in principle, encode relational knowledge in a more fine-grained way than is possible with knowledge graphs. To obtain relation embeddings from a pre-trained language model, we encode word pairs using a (manually or automatically generated) prompt, and we fine-tune the language model such that relationally similar word pairs yield similar output vectors.

In this paper, we analyze the capabilities of transformer-based language models on this unsupervised task, using benchmarks obtained from educational settings, as well as more commonly used datasets. We find that off-the-shelf language models can identify analogies to a certain extent, but struggle with abstract and complex relations, and results are highly sensitive to model architecture and hyperparameters.

First, we take advantage of contextualized language models (CLMs) rather than bags of word vectors to encode contexts. Second, rather than learning a word vector directly, we use a topic model to partition the contexts in which words appear, and then learn different topic-specific vectors for each word. Finally, we use a task-specific supervision signal to make a soft selection of the resulting vectors.

To better understand the medical reasoning capabilities of existing language models, in this paper we introduce DisKnE, a new benchmark for Disease Knowledge Evaluation. To construct this benchmark, we annotated each positive MedNLI example with the types of medical reasoning that are needed. We then created negative examples by corrupting these positive examples in an adversarial way. Furthermore, we define training-test splits per disease, ensuring that no knowledge about test diseases can be learned from the training data, and we canonicalize the formulation of the hypotheses to avoid the presence of artefacts.

In this article, we provide an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the celebrated BERT model with respect to lexical ambiguity. One of the main conclusions of our analysis is that BERT can accurately capture high-level sense distinctions, even when a limited number of examples is available for each word sense. Our analysis also reveals that in some cases language models come close to solving coarse-grained noun disambiguation under ideal conditions in terms of availability of training data and computing resources. However, this scenario rarely occurs in real-world settings and, hence, many practical challenges remain even in the coarse-grained setting. We also perform an in-depth comparison of the two main language model-based WSD strategies, namely, fine-tuning and feature extraction, finding that the latter approach is more robust with respect to sense bias and it can better exploit limited available training data. In fact, the simple feature extraction strategy of averaging contextualized embeddings proves robust even using only three training sentences per word sense, with minimal improvements obtained by increasing the size of this training data.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis and Evaluation of Language Models for Word Sense Disambiguation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis Espinosa-Anke","Joan Codina-Filba","Leo Wanner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"369a27b2f716bc1495d1a073060a2504","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/espinosa-anke-etal-2021-evaluating/","publishdate":"2022-02-19T23:12:41Z","relpermalink":"/publication/espinosa-anke-etal-2021-evaluating/","section":"publication","summary":"Lexical collocations are idiosyncratic combinations of two syntactically bound lexical items (e.g., ''heavy rain'' or ''take a step'').

In this paper, we perform an exhaustive analysis of current language models for collocation understanding.

We use a mixture-of-experts formulation to jointly learn these facet-specific embeddings. The individual entity embeddings are learned using a variant of the GloVe model, which has the advantage that we can easily identify which properties are modelled well in which of the learned embeddings.

We then apply state-of-the-art classification models to this dataset, providing a competitive set of baselines alongside qualitative error analysis. Our results show that language models perform reasonably well, and better than more traditional baselines. Nonetheless, there is clear room for improvement, particularly with unbalanced training sets and in cases where seemingly obvious linguistic cues (keywords) are used counter-intuitively.","tags":[],"title":"Towards Preemptive Detection of Depression and Anxiety in Twitter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Israa Alghanmi","Luis Espinosa-Anke","Steven Schockaert"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604188800,"objectID":"b737fb81b032169ecf204e5dcd455d7a","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/alghanmi-etal-2020-combining/","publishdate":"2022-02-19T23:41:36Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alghanmi-etal-2020-combining/","section":"publication","summary":"Pre-trained neural language models (LMs) have achieved impressive results in various natural language processing tasks, across different languages. Surprisingly, this extends to the social media genre, despite the fact that social media often has very different characteristics from the language that LMs have seen during training. A particularly striking example is the performance of AraBERT, an LM for the Arabic language, which is successful in categorizing social media posts in Arabic dialects, despite only having been trained on Modern Standard Arabic. Our hypothesis in this paper is that the performance of LMs for social media can nonetheless be improved by incorporating static word vectors that have been specifically trained on social media. We show that a simple method for incorporating such word vectors is indeed successful in several Arabic and English benchmarks. Curiously, however, we also find that similar improvements are possible with word vectors that have been trained on traditional text sources (e.g. Wikipedia).","tags":[],"title":"Combining BERT with Static Word Embeddings for Categorizing Social Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Loureiro","Jose Camacho-Collados"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604188800,"objectID":"30c72b0d17df3bc188d258fae0d022a5","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/loureiro-camacho-collados-2020-dont/","publishdate":"2022-02-19T22:52:11Z","relpermalink":"/publication/loureiro-camacho-collados-2020-dont/","section":"publication","summary":"State-of-the-art methods for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) combine two different features: the power of pre-trained language models and a propagation method to extend the coverage of such models. This propagation is needed as current sense-annotated corpora lack coverage of many instances in the underlying sense inventory (usually WordNet). At the same time, unambiguous words make for a large portion of all words in WordNet, while being poorly covered in existing sense-annotated corpora. In this paper, we propose a simple method to provide annotations for most unambiguous words in a large corpus.

Recently, there has been a thread of research aimed at modeling these relations by learning vector representations from text corpora. Most of these approaches focus strictly on leveraging the co-occurrences of relationship word pairs within sentences. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that examples of a lexical relation in a corpus are fundamental to a neural word embedding{'}s ability to complete analogies involving the relation. Our experiments, in which we remove all known examples of a relation from training corpora, show only marginal degradation in analogy completion performance involving the removed relation.

However, most existing evaluation benchmarks for assessing this criterion are tied to sense inventories (usually WordNet), restricting their usage to a small subset of knowledge-based representation techniques. The Word-in-Context dataset (WiC) addresses the dependence on sense inventories by reformulating the standard disambiguation task as a binary classification problem; but, it is limited to the English language. We put forward a large multilingual benchmark, XL-WiC, featuring gold standards in 12 new languages from varied language families and with different degrees of resource availability, opening room for evaluation scenarios such as zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. We perform a series of experiments to determine the reliability of the datasets and to set performance baselines for several recent contextualized multilingual models. Experimental results show that even when no tagged instances are available for a target language, models trained solely on the English data can attain competitive performance in the task of distinguishing different meanings of a word, even for distant languages.

Current practice is to manually assign companies to sectors or industries from a small predefined list, which has two key limitations. First, due to the manual effort involved, this strategy is only feasible for relatively mainstream industry segments, and can thus not easily be used for niche or emerging topics. Second, the use of hard label assignments ignores the fact that different companies will be more or less exposed to a particular segment. To address these limitations, we propose to learn vector representations of companies based on their annual reports. The key challenge is to distill the relevant information from these reports for characterizing their industries, since annual reports also contain a lot of information which is not relevant for our purpose. To this end, we introduce a multi-task learning strategy, which is based on fine-tuning the BERT language model on (i) existing sector labels and (ii) stock market performance.

However, the focus has been on a particular controlled scenario for evaluation, and there is no strong evidence on how current state-of-the-art systems would fare with noisy text or for language pairs with major linguistic differences.
